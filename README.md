# ProgDA-Task

## Programming for Data Analysis Task 2020

*Exploration of Python's NumPy library & in particular the numpy.random package as part of the Programming for Data Analysis Module 2020*

Submission date: 22nd November 2020


**Objectives:**

Provide detailed explanations with working examples for the following items in relation to the NumPy package:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Repository Files & Folders

List of files & folders contained within the Github Repository:

- Images folder - contains image files used within the Jupyter Notebook.
- .gitignore file -  specifies files to be untracked by git.
- NumPy.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook file containing all the descriptive & programming objectives of the assessment tasks.
- ProgDA_Assignment.pdf - full description of the Programming for Data Analysis tasks & objectives.
- README.md - This README markdown file.

## Jupyter Notebook

**Note:** all descriptive & programming objectives of the assessment have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, please refer to the [NumPy.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ProgDA-Task/blob/main/NumPy.ipynb) within this repository.

The notebook is assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therfore all code has been written & runs in Python.

##  Jupyter Notebook Environment

The jupyter notebook can be viewed as a static web page by opening the [NumPy.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ProgDA-Task/blob/main/NumPy.ipynb) file directly within this github repository. 

The fully interactive Jupyter notebook can be accessed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), the Python and R programming distribution which includes many data-science specific packages.

1. Download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Create a local copy of the Github Repository on your computer, either by downloading the zip file of the repository or by using the Git Clone command, refer to [Github Cloning a Repository Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Open the Anaconda Nagivator via the Windows Start Menu & launch the Jupyter Notebook web application or alternatively by opening terminal (cmd on Windows) & typing ``jupyter notebook``.
4. Within the Jupyter Notebook web application, nagivate to the folder location of the local copy of the repository & open the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file.
